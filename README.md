# HOWL

HOWL aims to provide a simple formant synthesizer.

## Todo

- Try old Klatt/soprano vocoder

- Turn Persistable into a Cocoapod
- Fix the keyboard duplicate note thing/get the keyboard to reload the view in a nicer way
- Fix the unstable bandpass filters (they saturate if you set BW to zero)
- Perhaps add proper intervals to the keyboard axis controls (or rename 'Left Interval' -> 'Left Semitones' or something)

- Reversible flip gestures

## Wishlist

- 3D touch
- Sound input support
- MIDI input support
- Custom iPad layout
