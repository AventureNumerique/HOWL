# GASP

GASP aims to provide a simple formant synthesizer with a minimum of configuration.

## Todo

### Interface

- Build out phonemeboard actions properly

- Phonemeboard
    - Should display rosette instead of waveform
    - Should fade colours

### Audio

- Synthesizer
    - Should sound beefier (more voices, slight detune)
    - Small amount of white noise?
    - Force touch: 
    - Options:
        - Waveform (square, sawtooth, triangle, pulse)

- Vocoder
    - Need to fix the 'rattle'
    - Need slight detune, variance on all params
    - Options:
        - Voice register (soprano, alto, tenor, bass)

- Master
    - Might need limiter
    - Tweak the reverb a little

## Wishlist

- Sound input support
- MIDI input support
- Custom iPad layout
