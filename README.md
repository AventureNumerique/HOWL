## Todo

### Interface

- Keyboard
    - Fix the duplicate note thing

- Synthesizer
    - Find elegant note reload thing

- Controls
    - Persistence

- Vocoder
    - Unstable filters (see when you lower bandwidth to zero)

- Phonemeboard
    - Should display rosette instead of waveform
    - Should fade colours
    - Crashing sporadically, also shows tearing...
    - Draw circle path and align letters correctly (perhaps only illuminate the circle)
