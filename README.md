# HOWL

HOWL is a simple formant synthesizer for iOS, built using the [AudioKit](https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit) framework.

It's extremely basic - just a sawtooth wave VCO run through four parallel banks of five bandpass filters.

## Building

Just open `HOWL.xcworkspace` in Xcode and hit build (as of the time of writing the latest version is Xcode 7.2).

## Wishlist

- Inter-app audio
- MIDI input support
- 3D touch
- Custom iPad layout
