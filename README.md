# HOWL

HOWL aims to provide a simple formant synthesizer with a minimum of configuration (no configuration whatsoever).

## Todo

### Interface

- Packaging
    - Fix splash screen (extra buttons)

- Controls
    - Configurability (decimal points, logarithmic, staircase, unit string etc should handle all situs)
    - KVO
    - Persistence

- Synth
    - Vibrato

- Phonemeboard
    - Should display rosette instead of waveform
    - Should fade colours
    - Crashing sporadically, also shows tearing...
    - Draw circle path and align letters correctly (perhaps only illuminate the circle)

## Wishlist

- 3D touch
- Sound input support
- MIDI input support
- Custom iPad layout
